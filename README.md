# 2. Project Architecture

- Three microservices were developed: order-ws, payment-ws, and status-ws, which communicate via AWS SNS and SQS. 

- When an order is created, it is saved in a PostgreSQL database and a message is sent to the ORDER_TOPIC, which then delivers the message to both the STATUS_QUEUE and PAYMENT_QUEUE. 

- Upon receipt, these queues store the messages in MongoDB. Whenever a payment is made or there is a change in the order status, messages are sent to the queues to process the updated status.

- In this phase of the project, transitioned to AWS ECS Fargate as a strategic move for economic efficiency and knowledge enhancement.


## 2.1. Projects Saga Pattern Architecture


### 2.1.1. Justification for Choosing the SAGA Pattern

The SAGA pattern with choreography was used in the snack bar project involving three separate microservices - order-ws (Order Service), payment-ws (Payment Service), and status-ws (Status Service) - offering a robust and scalable solution for managing distributed transactions and ensuring data consistency in a microservices environment. Below, I detail the reasons and justifications for adopting this pattern in this specific context.

#### 2.1.1.1. Distributed Transactions and Data Consistency
In the snack bar system, the process of placing an order is complex and involves several critical steps, such as order creation, payment processing, and order status updating. Each of these steps is the responsibility of a different microservice. The challenge is to ensure that, even when operating independently, all microservices maintain the system's overall consistency. The SAGA pattern, through a series of local transactions where each step knows how to compensate itself in case of failures, ensures this consistency without the need for a blocking distributed transaction.

#### 2.1.1.2. Decoupling and Flexibility
Using choreography, each microservice operates independently, publishing domain events when their operations are completed or when failures occur. Other services listen to these events and react accordingly, without the need for a central coordinator. This model promotes decoupling and flexibility, allowing each service to evolve, scale, and be maintained independently.

#### 2.1.1.3. Resilience and Failure Recovery
Failures are inevitable in distributed systems. The SAGA pattern, with its compensation-based approach, allows the system to recover gracefully. If a payment fails after an order has been created, the system can automatically cancel the order or attempt a new form of payment, maintaining data integrity. Choreography facilitates this recovery by allowing services to autonomously react to failure events.

#### 2.1.1.4. Visibility and Monitoring
Although choreography may introduce complexities in tracking the transaction flow, it also offers opportunities to implement effective monitoring and logging at each interaction point. This is crucial in a snack bar environment, where the speed and accuracy of the order are essential. Tracking order, payment, and status events in a unified dashboard can provide valuable operational insights and improve customer experience.

#### 2.1.1.5. Scalability
The SAGA pattern with choreography is naturally scalable. As services operate independently, responding to events asynchronously, the system can easily scale horizontally. This is especially beneficial during periods of high demand in a snack bar, such as lunches or special events, where the number of orders and payments can significantly increase.

Adopting the SAGA pattern with choreography in the snack bar project involving microservices order-ws, payment-ws, and status-ws offers a strategic solution to manage complex and distributed transactions, promoting decoupling, flexibility, resilience, and scalability. Although it presents challenges in terms of traceability and may require a learning curve for effective implementation, the benefits in terms of data consistency maintenance and failure recovery justify its use in this context.

## 3.3. Justification for Choosing PostgreSQL for a Restaurant System

- **Robust Performance**: PostgreSQL is known for delivering solid performance, even in high transaction volume environments. This is crucial for a restaurant system where it's essential to process orders quickly and efficiently, ensuring a seamless customer experience.

- **Reliability and Stability**: PostgreSQL is renowned for its stability and reliability. Restaurant systems need a database that can handle continuous and critical workloads, minimizing the risk of unexpected failures that could disrupt business operations.

- **Flexible Data Model**: PostgreSQL supports a variety of data types and offers support for advanced features such as foreign keys, indexes, and stored procedures. This allows for flexible data modeling, covering everything from menus and orders to employee and customer information.

- **Advanced Query Capabilities**: PostgreSQL has a powerful SQL query engine that allows for efficient execution of complex queries. This is crucial for generating reports and data analysis that can help restaurant owners and managers make informed decisions.

- **Active Community and Support**: PostgreSQL has an active community of developers and users worldwide. This means you'll have access to ongoing technical support, updates, and security fixes. Additionally, many resources and plugins are available to customize the system to meet the restaurant's specific needs.

- **Cost-Effective**: PostgreSQL is an open-source database, which means it's a cost-effective option compared to many commercial database management systems. This can be especially advantageous for restaurants with budget constraints.

- **Integration and Scalability**: PostgreSQL is highly compatible with many programming languages and can be easily integrated with other parts of the restaurant system, such as online ordering apps, inventory management systems, and more. Furthermore, it is scalable, allowing the database to grow as the restaurant expands its operations.

In summary, PostgreSQL offers a solid combination of performance, reliability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, making it a sensible choice for a restaurant system that requires a robust and dependable database to meet critical business needs.

  ```
  
---


### 3.8.2. Kubernetes (k8s)

#### 3.8.2.1. To initiate Kubernetes applications, execute the commands found within the "k8s" folder.

```
$ kubectl apply -f delivery/k8s/postgres/.
```

```
$ kubectl apply -f delivery/k8s/application/.
```


#### 3.8.2.2. o access the application URL, use the following command:

```
$ minikube service delivery --url
```

#### 3.8.2.3. Example output:
```
http://192.168.49.2:32000

```

Inside the "k8s" folder, you will discover ".yaml" files utilized to deploy databases and applications within Kubernetes.

```
/delivery/k8s
â”œâ”€â”€ application
|  â”œâ”€â”€ 1-deployment.yaml

## 3.9. Deploy Github-actions


![Alt text](images/mvp_ci_cd.png "Deploy Github-actions")


---
###  3.9.1. Integration Mercado Pago 

For the webhook checkout process, generate a QR code.

For testing full process with Mercado Pago webhook, use hookdeck.com with CLI to change the order status in the localhost application.

Apllication path **/api/v1/mp-order/qr-code-checkout** creates a checkout with Mercado Pago.


Example:

```json
{
    "in_store_order_id": "75ca8fe9-3b1a-4053-8f3e-49a62e91f8e8",
    "qr_data": "00020101021243650016COM.MERCADOLIBRE02013063675ca8fe9-3b1a-4053-8f3e-49a62e91f8e85204000053039865802BR5908delivery6009SAO PAULO62070503***63042BFA"
}
```

---
### 3.9.2. This project uses [CommandLineRunner](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/CommandLineRunner.html)
- CommandLineRunner is used to create a default user, products and categories on start application startup.
- Default login :

**/api/auth/login-token**
```json
{
  "username": "99999999999",
  "password": "123"
}
```
---

## 3.10. The best way to use it as a suggestion is by using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
#### 3.10.0.1. A collection is available preconfigured in the project root
[MVP - Pos tech delivery application.postman_collection.json]()

- This project uses user and session control for access
- Endpoints without control access  _**"/api/auth/*"**_, **_"/api/v1/users/signup"_**

#### 3.10.0.2. Create new user example:
http://localhost:8099/api/v1/users/signup

Body:
```json
{
    "name": "Admin",
    "email": "admin@email.com",
    "cpf": "99999999999",
    "password": "admin",
    "address": {
        "street": "rua 1",
        "city": "sp",
        "state": "sp",
        "postalCode": "1234"
    }
}
```

<br/>

#### 3.10.0.3. Login - Use the username (cpf) and password, then copy the token and use it in authenticated endpoints.

http://localhost:8099/api/auth/login-token
```json
{
  "username": "99999999999",
  "password": "admin"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZENsaWVudCI6IjAiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4OTEyIiwic3ViIjoiMTIzNDU2Nzg5MTIiLCJpYXQiOjE2ODgwOTI1NTAsImF1ZCI6Im5vLWFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLW5hbWUiLCJleHAiOjE2ODgwOTQwMDB9.HagYPqukwOML3OYad8sRjlnE0Gsy-5tGUSC72S-xyfU"
}
```

### 3.10.1. ðŸ’¡To make it easier use environment variables 
#### 3.10.1.1. Place the command in the test tab on /api/auth/login-token
```sh
pm.environment.set("token", pm.response.json().token);
```

#### 3.10.1.2. Example:
