   ├── variables.tf
   ├── vpc.tf
   └── workstation-external-ip.tf

```

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (you can use `terraform --version` to check)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for interacting with the cluster
- [kubectl-aws-iam-authenticator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html) for authenticating with the EKS cluster
- Internet access

### Repository

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lfneves/infra-eks-terraform.git

   cd infra-eks-terraform
   ```

2. Automatically create a `delivery-eks-terraform.tfstate` file and deploy bucket on `delivery-terraform-s3` and provide the necessary variables:

   ```hcl
   region            = "us-east-1"
   cluster_name      = "delivery-cluster"
   node_instance_type = "t2.small"
   node_max_count     = 1
   node_min_count     = 1
   ```

## Justification for Choosing PostgreSQL for a Restaurant System

- **Robust Performance**: PostgreSQL is known for delivering solid performance, even in high transaction volume environments. This is crucial for a restaurant system where it's essential to process orders quickly and efficiently, ensuring a seamless customer experience.

- **Reliability and Stability**: PostgreSQL is renowned for its stability and reliability. Restaurant systems need a database that can handle continuous and critical workloads, minimizing the risk of unexpected failures that could disrupt business operations.

- **Flexible Data Model**: PostgreSQL supports a variety of data types and offers support for advanced features such as foreign keys, indexes, and stored procedures. This allows for flexible data modeling, covering everything from menus and orders to employee and customer information.

- **Advanced Query Capabilities**: PostgreSQL has a powerful SQL query engine that allows for efficient execution of complex queries. This is crucial for generating reports and data analysis that can help restaurant owners and managers make informed decisions.

- **Active Community and Support**: PostgreSQL has an active community of developers and users worldwide. This means you'll have access to ongoing technical support, updates, and security fixes. Additionally, many resources and plugins are available to customize the system to meet the restaurant's specific needs.

- **Cost-Effective**: PostgreSQL is an open-source database, which means it's a cost-effective option compared to many commercial database management systems. This can be especially advantageous for restaurants with budget constraints.

- **Integration and Scalability**: PostgreSQL is highly compatible with many programming languages and can be easily integrated with other parts of the restaurant system, such as online ordering apps, inventory management systems, and more. Furthermore, it is scalable, allowing the database to grow as the restaurant expands its operations.

In summary, PostgreSQL offers a solid combination of performance, reliability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, making it a sensible choice for a restaurant system that requires a robust and dependable database to meet critical business needs.

### Application mvp

https://github.com/lfneves/mvp

#### This is a [Spring Boot WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html) application using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

Spring WebFlux utilizes the [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) library, which is an implementation of Reactive Streams specs for building non-blocking applications.

This project:
- Uses [Reactor Netty as the default implementation](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty) for testing purposes. To change to Apache Tomcat as the default Web container for Spring WebFlux, follow these steps.
- Utilizes functional endpoints.
- Employs the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

```sh
# Get the latest version

git clone https://github.com/lfneves/mvp.git
```

## Project Structure


```

├── kotlin
|  └── com
|     └── mvp
|        └── delivery
|           ├── DeliveryApplication.kt
|           ├── application
|           ├── domain
|           ├── infrastruture
|           └── utils
└── resources
   ├── application.yml
   └── database
      ├── 1_create_tables.sql
      └── 2_inserts_category.sql
```

### Prerequisites
Check versions:
* Java 17+
  ```sh
  java --version
  ```

* Docker
  ```sh
  docker -v
  ```

* Docker Compose
  ```sh
  docker-compose --version
  ```

## Installation
This is an example of how to use the software and how to install it.


### Docker

In the main project directory:

  
  Docker build and start applications:
  ```sh 
  $ docker-compose up --build
  ```
  
   Or use:
   
  ```
  $ docker-compose up -d --build
  ```
  

  To recreate the application in case of problems, use the command:
    
  ```
  $ docker-compose down
  ```
  
---


### Kubernetes (k8s)

#### To initiate Kubernetes applications, execute the commands found within the "k8s" folder.

```
$ kubectl apply -f delivery/k8s/postgres/.
```

```
$ kubectl apply -f delivery/k8s/application/.
```


#### o access the application URL, use the following command:

```
$ minikube service delivery --url
```

#### Example output:
```
http://192.168.49.2:32000

```

Inside the "k8s" folder, you will discover ".yaml" files utilized to deploy databases and applications within Kubernetes.

```
/delivery/k8s
├── application
|  ├── 1-deployment.yaml
|  ├── 2-service-load-balancer.yaml
|  ├── 3-hpa.yaml
|  ├── 4-ingress.yaml
|
└── postgres
   ├── 1-db-persistent-volume.yaml
   ├── 2-db-volume-claim.yaml
   ├── 3-db-configmap.yaml
   ├── 4-db-secret.yaml
   ├── 5-db-deployment.yaml
   └── 6-db-service.yaml
```

#### Metric Server 

```
$ minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

To monitor the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, employ the following command:
```
$ kubectl get hpa
```
![Alt text](images/hpa_example_img.png "Horizontal Pod Autoscaler")

---

###  Kubernetes (k8s) - Install with Helm 

[BETA] Because this hasn't been implemented following best practices.

```
$ helm install deliveryhelm deliveryhelm/
```

#### Helm uninstall

```
$ helm uninstall deliveryhelm deliveryhelm/
```

## Deploy Github-actions


![Alt text](images/mvp_ci_cd.png "Deploy Github-actions")


---
###  Integration Mercado Pago 

For the webhook checkout process, generate a QR code.

For testing full process with Mercado Pago webhook, use hookdeck.com with CLI to change the order status in the localhost application.

Apllication path **/api/v1/mp-order/qr-code-checkout** creates a checkout with Mercado Pago.


Example:

```json
{
    "in_store_order_id": "75ca8fe9-3b1a-4053-8f3e-49a62e91f8e8",
    "qr_data": "00020101021243650016COM.MERCADOLIBRE02013063675ca8fe9-3b1a-4053-8f3e-49a62e91f8e85204000053039865802BR5908delivery6009SAO PAULO62070503***63042BFA"
}
```

---
### This project uses [CommandLineRunner](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/CommandLineRunner.html)
- CommandLineRunner is used to create a default user, products and categories on start application startup.
- Default login :

**/api/auth/login-token**
```json
{
  "username": "99999999999",
  "password": "123"
}
```
---

## The best way to use it as a suggestion is by using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
#### A collection is available preconfigured in the project root
[MVP - Pos tech delivery application.postman_collection.json]()

- This project uses user and session control for access
- Endpoints without control access  _**"/api/auth/*"**_, **_"/api/v1/users/signup"_**

#### Create new user example:
http://localhost:8099/api/v1/users/signup

Body:
```json
{
    "name": "Admin",
    "email": "admin@email.com",
    "cpf": "99999999999",
    "password": "admin",
    "address": {
        "street": "rua 1",
        "city": "sp",
        "state": "sp",
        "postalCode": "1234"
    }
}
```

<br/>

#### Login - Use the username (cpf) and password, then copy the token and use it in authenticated endpoints.

http://localhost:8099/api/auth/login-token
```json
{
  "username": "99999999999",
  "password": "admin"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
"token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZENsaWVudCI6IjAiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4OTEyIiwic3ViIjoiMTIzNDU2Nzg5MTIiLCJpYXQiOjE2ODgwOTI1NTAsImF1ZCI6Im5vLWFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLW5hbWUiLCJleHAiOjE2ODgwOTQwMDB9.HagYPqukwOML3OYad8sRjlnE0Gsy-5tGUSC72S-xyfU"
}
```

### 💡To make it easier use environment variables 
#### Place the command in the test tab on /api/auth/login-token
```sh
pm.environment.set("token", pm.response.json().token);
```

#### Example:
